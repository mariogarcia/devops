# CONSUL INSTALLATION
# -------------------
# This Ansible tasks install a Consul cluster
# of 2 nodes (leader/follower).
#
# - sets hosts names. This is required as Consul
#   checks hostnames aren't the same
# - downloads Consul
# - installs Consul as a service

# sets hostnames
- name: hostname leader
  hostname:
    name: consuln1
  when: consul_role == "leader"

- name: hostname follower
  hostname:
    name: consuln2
  when: consul_role == "follower"

- name: Add the inventory into /etc/hosts
  lineinfile:
    dest: /etc/hosts
    regexp: '.*{{ item }}$'
    line: "{{item}} {{ hostvars[item]['hostname'] }}"
    state: present
  when: hostvars[item]['ansible_facts']['hostname'] is defined
  with_items:
    - "{{ groups['all'] }}"
